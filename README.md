parkinson data challenge 2013

This package is used to analysis data provided by Fox Foundation on finding relations between cellphone captured data and parkinson disease. The package should include three different parts: data cleansing, model development, and support utilities.

Currently, all works have been focused on cleansing data and building support utilities.

Supporting library is divided into three groups: file related, data related, and other utilities. They are contained in the folder 'packages'.

PROGRESS:
    1. Methods for T-Test and ANOVA were created;
    2. Found that Accelerometer data are good idicators for parkinson's patiences.
    3. Need to find ways to create standards for non-patiences.
